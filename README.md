# Flask Vue Stack

Quick way to make a full stack web server using flask, vue.js v2, and sqlite with sqlalchemy.

The `links.html` and `tags.html` are taken from another project and are mostly here as useful examples.

## Set up virtual env
```
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run the server
```
python app.py

```
